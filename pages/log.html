"Genki" is a popular series of Japanese language textbooks that are widely used in classrooms and by self-learners. The series is designed to teach Japanese to beginners and is divided into two main books: Genki 1 and Genki 2.

        Automated the 'Last edited on' footer tag.

The aim was to create a self-contained, zero-dependency binary that builds the website
from html templates. There's still quite a few improvements to make, but the first steps are 
in place.
