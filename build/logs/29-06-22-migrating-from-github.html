The article was written in response to the release of <a class="font-bold underline" href="https://github.com/features/copilot" >Github Copilot</a >, or rather it's release from beta - and as you might already  have guessed from the title, the review isn't great. </p><p> Admittedly, I've used it during it's beta-phase (not knowing of it's controversy), and was quite suprised by how well it worked. I came in with low expectations, thinking it might throw some random foo-bar code guesses as I worked, but I found it adapted quite well to whatever I was working on, and that a good amount of the suggestions, whilst not perfect, where at least helpful. </p><p> It even critiqued my code at one point when I began to write a comment "TODO: Componentize this.". </p><p> It helpfully suggested the text, <i>"It's a mess".</i> </p><p>And yes, it was at that point I <i>swiftly</i> removed it. /s</p><p> The article goes on to suggest that Github is against FOSS philosophy. And that this is not a new accusation, but rather one that has been building up with more and more evidence for some time. The release of this new tool was simply the straw that broke the camel's back. </p><p> The part that I found most interesting was the quote "permissible to train the model (and allow users to generate code based on that model) on any code whatsoever and not be bound by any licensing terms". Put abruptly, it ignores licenses, including the ones which require author attribution. </p><p> This seems to be a legal and ethical grey area. It seems sketchy. </p><p> Furthermore, it appears that their model was not trained on any code belonging to github, or any of microsoft repositories for that matter. </p><p>Seems sketchier.</p><p> I'm not against Github, nor would I say my feelings are held strongly in any way, but I would like to minimize my participation with the platform given recent events. </p><p> I've since moved over to <a class="font-bold underline" href="https://sr.ht/">sourcehut</a> in it's replacement. </p><a href="../logs.html" class="underline">> Back to Posts </a></section></main></div></div><footer class="max-w-[90rem] h-20 mt-auto mb-4 py-2 pl-10"><span class="mb-3 sm:mb-0"><strong>Dawbs Â© 2022 </strong></span><div><a class="underline" href="https://sr.ht/~dawbs/"> sr.ht </a></div></footer></body></html>
