          <p>
            I stumbled across an article on hackernews earlier today, titled
            <a
              class="font-bold underline"
              href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31932250"
              >'Give up Github: The time has come'</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amongst my many weaknesses comes the ability to be allured by a
            clickbait title so, unsuprisingly, I clicked it. The article was
            written in response to the release of
            <a
              class="font-bold underline"
              href="https://github.com/features/copilot"
              >Github Copilot</a
            >, or rather it's release from beta - and as you might already have
            guessed from the title, the review isn't great.
          </p>
          <p>
            Admittedly, I've used it during it's beta-phase (not knowing of it's
            controversy), and was quite suprised by how well it worked. I came
            in with low expectations, thinking it might throw some random
            foo-bar code guesses as I worked, but I found it adapted quite well
            to whatever I was working on, and that a good amount of the
            suggestions, whilst not perfect, where at least helpful.
          </p>
          <p>
            It even critiqued my code at one point when I began to write a
            comment "TODO: Componentize this.".
          </p>
          <p>
            It helpfully suggested the text,
            <i>"It's a mess".</i>
          </p>
          <p>And yes, it was at that point I <i>swiftly</i> removed it. /s</p>
          <p>
            The article goes on to suggest that Github is against FOSS
            philosophy. And that this is not a new accusation, but rather one
            that has been building up with more and more evidence for some time.
            The release of this new tool was simply the straw that broke the
            camel's back.
          </p>
          <p>
            The part that I found most interesting was the quote "permissible to
            train the model (and allow users to generate code based on that
            model) on any code whatsoever and not be bound by any licensing
            terms". Put abruptly, it ignores licenses, including the ones which
            require author attribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            This seems to be a legal and ethical grey area. It seems sketchy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, it appears that their model was not trained on any code
            belonging to github, or any of microsoft repositories for that
            matter.
          </p>
          <p>Seems sketchier.</p>
          <p>
            I'm not against Github, nor would I say my feelings are held
            strongly in any way, but I would like to minimize my participation
            with the platform given recent events.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've since moved over to
            <a class="font-bold underline" href="https://sr.ht/">sourcehut</a>
            in it's replacement.
